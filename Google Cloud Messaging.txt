When the application server needs to push a message to the Android application, it sends the message via an HTTP POST to Google’s C2DM servers.

The C2DM servers route the message to the device. If the device is not online, the message will be delivered once the device is available.

C2DM messages are limited in size to 1024 bytes and are intended to inform the device about new data not to transfer it. 
The typical workflow is that Googles C2DM servers notify the Android app that new data is available. 
Afterwards the Android app fetches the data from a different server.

Android devices maintain a connection to the Android Play server. C2DM uses this existing connections to the Google servers.


How push notifications work

With Android devices, all push notifications are sent through the same transport service – Google Cloud Messenger (GCM). 
This allows many applications to receive notifications without requiring an open connection for each one.

Before a device can receive a message, it registers with GCM and gets a token. 
This token can then be used (along with a second key) to send notifications to your device.

In the case of push notifications, however, it is the server initiating the data transfer.

This is usually accomplished by maintaining a persistent TCP/IP connection—a connection that stays open indefinitely—between
the server and the client. That might sound great, but if you have a popular app, maintaining thousands of persistent
connections between your server and the devices of your users can be very expensive.
